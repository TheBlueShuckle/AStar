Defs:
	GetNeighbors (done)
	EstimateCost
	FindCheapestNeighbor

Pseudo Code:
	EstimateCost(start, goal):
		g is the cost from start to current tile
		h is the estimated cost from current tile to goal (use euclidiean distance, aka pythagorean distance) 

		returns g + h (the f-cost)

	FindCheapestNeighbor(tile):
		cheapestTile = null

		for each neighbor of GetNeighbors(tile):
			if cheapestTile is null or EstimateCost(tile) < EstimateCost(cheapestTile)
				cheapestTile = tile
		
		return tile

Problems:
	Figure out how to store the cost of tile.
